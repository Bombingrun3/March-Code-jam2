## Future feature ideas
Due to the time constraint we were not able to implement all the features we'd hope to. These include the following:

-**EcoHabits**:
  A short section about daily changes that make long-lasting impacts on eco-sustainability.

-**EcoShare**:
 An API system that when users click one of the social media logos it automatically creates a post that can be modified if necessary. 

-**EcoChallenges**:
  Weekly or monthly challenges for users to participate in. Challenges can include "Zero-Waste Week", "Plastic-Free Month", etc. 

-**EcoMap**:
An interactive API that links users to local green initiatives near them. 

-**EcoIcons**:
A monthly section that highlights ecological pioneers in various fields from engineering to greener government policies and more.
